1)What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and
parentheses?
square brackets []: This creates a list. The entire comprehension is evaluated and stored in memory immediately.
Parentheses (): This creates a generator. Instead of building the entire list in memory at once, it generates items one at a time as they are needed, saving memory for large datasets.

2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?
All generators are iterators, but not all iterators are generators.
Both generators and iterators can be iterated over using next(), and they raise StopIteration when exhausted.
The main difference is how they are created: generators are defined using the yield keyword inside a function, while iterators can be any object that implements the iterator protocol

3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?
A generator function uses yield to return values incrementally, rather than return.
When invoked, the function returns a generator object, not the final result of its computation.
The function pauses after each yield and resumes execution when the next value is requested.

4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?
he purpose of the yield statement in Python is to turn a regular function into a generator, allowing it to produce a sequence of values lazily (i.e., one at a time, as needed) instead of computing and returning them all at once

5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and
contrast between the two.
Map Calls:
  Takes a function and an iterable as arguments.
  Applies the function to each element of the iterable.
  Returns a map object, which is an iterator.
  To get the actual results, you need to convert the map object to a list or other sequence type.
List Comprehensions:
  Combines the creation of a new list with the application of a function to each element.
  The expression part is evaluated for each element in the iterable.
  The if condition part is optional and filters the elements based on a condition.
  Directly returns a new list.
