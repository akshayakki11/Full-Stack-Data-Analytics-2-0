1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators

Ans->  In the following elements the values are 'hello', -87.8, 6 and Expressions are *, -, /, +

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans-> String is a data type, a sequence of characters. In python a string is represented with single or double quotes. Whereas a variable is a naem that holds / refers any values. 
It can be of any data type such as int, float, boolean, string etc

3. Describe three different data types

Ans->
Int - Integer data type contains a whole number(non floating value). It can be negative or positive whole number. Eg -> 50, -23, 1, 5
Float - Float data type contains franctions(numbers with decimals). Eg-> 2.365, 50.21, 12.0
String - String data type contains sequence of characters. It can be represented with '' or "". Eg -> "Data Analytics", 'Hello World', '99999'

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Ans-> An expression can be made up off variables, values and operators. It produces some result after being interpreted

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

Ans-> An expression evaluates to a value, whereas a statement performs an action. In the assignment statement "spam = 10", "spam" is a variable, and "10" is a value. 
The entire statement is an example of a statement because it assigns the value 10 to the variable spam

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

Ans-> the value 22 is stored in variable bacon. next, when 1 is added to it the value becomes 23 but will not change the original value 22 which is stored in bacon variable. 

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

8 .Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Ans-> A Variable in python can start with a letter or an underscore. Here eggs is a valid python varible which startswith a letter whereas 100 starts with a numeric value
and is an invalid variable type in python

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?

Ans-> 
int(): Converts a value to an integer.
float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.
str(): Converts a value to a string.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

Ans-> Because A string and a int value cannot be concatinated. First we need to convert the int vlaue to string and then concate with string value. 
'I have eaten' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
