1. Create a list called years_list, starting with the year of your birth, and each year thereafter until
the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you were born in 1980. the list would be years_list =
[1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985].

 Create years_list
birth_year = 1980  # Replace with your actual birth year
years_list = list(range(birth_year, birth_year + 6))  # Creates list from birth year to 5th birthday year

2. In which year in years_list was your third birthday? Remember, you were 0 years of age for your
first year.
ear of your third birthday
third_birthday_year = years_list[2]  # Accesses element at index 2 (year 2 after birth)

3.In the years list, which year were you the oldest?
 Year you were the oldest
oldest_year = years_list[-1]  # Accesses the last element (your 5th birthday year)

4. Make a list called things with these three strings as elements: &quot;mozzarella&quot;, &quot;cinderella&quot;,
&quot;salmonella&quot;.
Create a list called things
things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]

5. Capitalize the element in things that refers to a person and then print the list. Did it change the
element in the list?
Capitalize the element referring to a person
things[1] = things[1].title()  # Capitalizes the second element ("Cinderella")
print(things)  # Printing shows the list remains unchanged

6. Make a surprise list with the elements &quot;Groucho,&quot; &quot;Chico,&quot; and &quot;Harpo.&quot;
Create a surprise list
surprise_list = ["Groucho", "Chico", "Harpo"]

7. Lowercase the last element of the surprise list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.
Modify and print the last element
surprise_list[-1] = surprise_list[-1].lower()  # Lowercase the last element
surprise_list.reverse()  # Reverse the order
surprise_list[-1] = surprise_list[-1].upper()  # Uppercase the last element (now first)
print(surprise_list)  # Prints ["HARPO", "chico", "Groucho"]

8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it. Here are your starter words: dog is
chien, cat is chat, and walrus is morse.
English-to-French dictionary
e2f = {"dog": "chien", "cat": "chat", "walrus": "morse"}
print(e2f)

9. Write the French word for walrus in your three-word dictionary e2f.
French word for walrus
walrus_word = e2f["walrus"]
print(walrus_word)  # Prints "morse"

10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.
 French-to-English dictionary
f2e = {value: key for key, value in e2f.items()}  # Creates dictionary from reversed key-value pairs

11. Print the English version of the French word chien using f2e.
English equivalent of "chien"
english_chien = f2e["chien"]
print(english_chien)  # Prints "dog"

12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in e2f.
Set of English words from e2f keys
english_words = set(e2f.keys())
print(english_words)  # Prints {"dog", "cat", "walrus"}

13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys: &#39;animals&#39;, &#39;plants&#39;,
and &#39;other&#39;. Make the &#39;animals&#39; key refer to another dictionary with the keys &#39;cats&#39;, &#39;octopi&#39;, and
&#39;emus&#39;. Make the &#39;cats&#39; key refer to a list of strings with the values &#39;Henri&#39;, &#39;Grumpy&#39;, and &#39;Lucy&#39;.
Make all the other keys refer to empty dictionaries.
 Multilevel dictionary
life = {
    'animals': {
        'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'],
        'octopi': {},  # Empty dictionary
        'emus': {}  # Empty dictionary
    },
    'plants': {},  # Empty dictionary
    'other': {}  # Empty dictionary
}

14. Print the top-level keys of life.
Print top-level keys
print(life.keys())  # Prints dict_keys(['animals', 'plants', 'other'])

15. Print the keys for life[&#39;animals&#39;].
Print keys for 'animals'
print(life['animals'].keys())  # Prints dict_keys(['cats', 'octopi', 'emus'])

16. Print the values for life[&#39;animals&#39;][&#39;cats&#39;]
Print values for 'cats'
print(life['animals']['cats'])  # Prints ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy']
