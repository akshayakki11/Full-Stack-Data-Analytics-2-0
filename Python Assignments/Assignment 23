1. What is the result of the code, and why?
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a, b=6, c=8):
print(a, b, c)
&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2)

The result is: 1 2 8
func is defined with three parameters: a, b (with a default value of 6), and c (with a default value of 8).
The third parameter, c, is not provided in the function call, so it uses its default value, which is 8
Inside the function, print(a, b, c) prints the values of a, b, and c in the order they are passed or assigned

2. 
What is the result of this code, and why?
def func(a, b, c=5):
print(a, b, c)
 func(1, c=3, b=2)

The result is: 1 2 3
The function func takes three arguments: a, b, and c. The argument c has a default value of 5
a is assigned the value 1.
c is assigned the value 3, overriding the default value of 5.
b is assigned the value 2
Inside the function, the values of a, b, and c are printed. Therefore, the output is 1 2 3.

3. How about this code: what is its result, and why?
def func(a, *pargs):
print(a, pargs)
func(1, 2, 3)

The result is: 1 (2, 3)
The function func takes two arguments: a and *pargs.a is a normal positional argument.
*pargs is a special syntax that collects any additional positional arguments into a tuple.
a is assigned the value 1.
*pargs collects the remaining arguments (2 and 3) into a tuple.

4. What does this code print, and why?
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a, **kargs):
print(a, kargs)
&gt;&gt;&gt; func(a=1, c=3, b=2)

The result is: 1 {'c': 3, 'b': 2}

the function func takes two arguments: a and **kargs.
a is a normal positional argument.
**kargs is a special syntax that collects any keyword arguments into a dictionary.
a is assigned the value 1.
**kargs collects the remaining keyword arguments (c=3 and b=2) into a dictionary

5. What gets printed by this, and explain?
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a, b, c=8, d=5): print(a, b, c, d)
&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, *(5, 6))

The result is: 1 5 6 5
The function func takes four arguments: a, b, c, and d. The arguments c and d have default values of 8 and 5, respectively
a is assigned the value 1.
*(5, 6) unpacks the tuple (5, 6) into positional arguments. This means that b is assigned the value 5 and c is assigned the value 6.
Since d was not provided as an argument, it retains its default value of 5.

6. what is the result of this, and explain?
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a, b, c): a = 2; b[0] = &#39;x&#39;; c[&#39;a&#39;] = &#39;y&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; l=1; m=[1]; n={&#39;a&#39;:0}
&gt;&gt;&gt; func(l, m, n)

The result is: 2 ['x'] {'a': 'y'}

The function func takes three arguments: a, b, and c.
