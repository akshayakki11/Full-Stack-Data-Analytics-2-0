1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.

def add_current_date_to_file(filename):
  with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    current_date = datetime.date.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    file.write(current_date)

2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string

with open('today.txt', 'r') as file:
  today_string = file.read()

3. Parse the date from today_string.
today_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(today_string, '%Y-%m-%d').date()

4. List the files in your current directory
current_directory_files = os.listdir('.')
print("Files in the current directory:", current_directory_files)

5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).

parent_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
parent_directory_files = os.listdir(parent_directory)
print("Files in the parent directory:", parent_directory_files)

6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of
seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.

import multiprocessing
import datetime
def wait_and_print():
  time.sleep(datetime.timedelta(seconds=random.randint(1, 5)).total_seconds())
  print(datetime.datetime.now())
processes = []
for _ in range(3):
  p = multiprocessing.Process(target=wait_and_print)
  processes.append(p)
  p.start()

for p in processes:
  p.join()

7. Create a date object of your day of birth.
birth_date = datetime.date(2000, 02, 25)

8. What day of the week was your day of birth?
birth_day_of_week = birth_date.strftime('%A')
print("Your day of birth was a", birth_day_of_week)

9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?
ten_thousand_days_old = birth_date + datetime.timedelta(days=10000)
print("You will be 10,000 days old on", ten_thousand_days_old)
